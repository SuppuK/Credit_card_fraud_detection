# Credit_card_fraud_detection
Problem statement - to predict fraudulent credit card transactions with the help of machine learning models.
 
In this project, customer-level data that has been collected and analysed during a research collaboration of Worldline and the Machine Learning Group was anaysed. 
 
The data set is taken from the Kaggle website and has a total of 2,84,807 transactions; out of these, 492 are fraudulent. Since the data set was highly imbalanced, same was handled before model building.
